  asd: "I'm also on the autism spectrum and have been  diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While I don't know  everything about the subject, my personal experience with ASD has  given me unique insights into the challenges and strengths that come  with being on the spectrum. I believe that my attention to detail,  focus, and analytical thinking are some of my greatest strengths that  have helped me in my professional and personal life.",
  Interests:
    "When I'm not working, I enjoy practicing jiu-jitsu, which I've been doing for eight months, and indoor bouldering, which I've been doing for five years. These activities  help me to stay active and keep my mind sharp. Thanks for giving me  the opportunity to introduce myself! If you have any questions or  would like to chat more, please don't hesitate to reach out.",
